Install and run

Design choices

- Chose to accept only values up to 10,000,000 to ensure we don't crash the
  server.

Frontend

- single page application due to the limited functionality required
- Chose to use VITE for frontend React application bundling for ease of setup

Backend

- Chose to utilize the Seive of Eratosthenes algorithm for optimal performance

Testing

- I chose to use Vitest for ease of setup and speed of testing

Things I'd do with more time

- Split the frontend App component into a form component and results component
  to minimize unnecessary re-renders
